# [AIU's Library]

## Author: Natalia Maiatskaia COM19-A

### Description:

Each university has its own library. Unfortunately, there are not enough books for all students.In order for the librarian to see exactly how many books are left, I have created an app where employee can add books, edit its number, link the book to the student and see the date when the student must turn in the book.

### Relevance:

It is a very useful application for librarians and students. Students can see left amount of books they needed. Librarians can see the due dates for returning books and control it.

### Problem Solution:

This application can save time for students, because they can check whether the book is available, if not, they don't go to the library. Librarians can easily control the amount and availability of books, easyly add and delete them.

# Presentation:

## There is the first and main window: 

Here we can see the list of all books, with it's amount. There are 4 buttons on the bottom, and the search box on the top.

When we put the book name, author name or amounts of the book, the appropriate raws are stay, and the unwanted raws are disappear:

By clicking on the button named "Add Book" we move to a new window, where we can fill all the text fields and add the book to a database. To save it, we need to click "Apply"
